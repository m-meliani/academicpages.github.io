I am a PhD candidate working in the field of evolution equations for acoustics under the supervision of [Dr. Vanja NikoliÄ‡](https://vanjanikolic.net). My research interests lie at the intersection of well-posedness theory, limiting behavior, and singular limits of nonlinear and nonlocal-in-time wave equations. I have also worked on problems pertaining to PDE-constrained shape optimization and error analysis of numerical schemes for nonlinear wave equations.
