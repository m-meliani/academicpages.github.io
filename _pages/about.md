I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Evolution Differential Equation of the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague under the supervision of [Prof. Eduard Feireisl](https://www.math.cas.cz/index.php/members/researcher/37). I obtained my PhD working in the field of evolution equations for acoustics under the supervision of [Dr. Vanja Nikolić](https://vanjanikolic.net). My research interests lie at the intersection of well-posedness theory, asymptotic behavior, and singular limits of nonlinear and nonlocal-in-time wave equations. I have also worked on problems pertaining to PDE-constrained shape optimization and error analysis of numerical schemes for nonlinear wave equations.
